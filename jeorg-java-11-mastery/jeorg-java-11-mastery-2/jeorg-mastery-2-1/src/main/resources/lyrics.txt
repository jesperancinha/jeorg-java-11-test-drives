Each character is represented by a different instrument of the synthesized orchestra.
For instance, the part of Billy the Bird is played by a flute, like this...
The part of Bruce the Duck is played by an oboe...
Louie the Cat is a clarinet. All right, he's not really a clarinet. He's just - you know, he's represented by a clarinet...
The part of the Grandfather will be played by Don Amiche.
He... what?
Can't make it? Oh. Huh.
Okay, um, hmm, in that case, the part of the Grandfather will be played by, huh, a bassoon...
